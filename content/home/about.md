# Biography

'statistical learning' rather than 'machine learning' or 'statistical modeling'! 

My name is Tay Shin who is interested in almost everything related to statistical analysis/modeling. 
I received statistics degree at the University of Berkeley, and I also took numerous comp. sci., econometrics, and math courses.
I have a lot of professional experience in data analysis/modeling, especially in 2016, I received Ministerial Citation at the Minister of National Defence for making a labor cost prediction model.
Lastly, I'm a Kaggler!
